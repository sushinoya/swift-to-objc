# Swift to Objective-C

## Main Criteria for comparison
- Working with `nil`
- Limited mutability
- Dynamic vs Static Typing
- Design Patterns and iOS Libraries

### Similarities
- Both have **single inheritance** (i.e a class can inherit from only one other class). So they both use protocols to enable shared functionality across classes.
- Same methods provided by the iOS libraries such as the 6 default methods in AppDelegate.
